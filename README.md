# Useful scripts and configs for WSL

A collection of adjustments I made to the default WSL system. Since the repeated setup (on each new machine or WSL instance) became tedious at some point, I decided to make this collection and automate the most important steps.

Works with default WSL distribution (Ubuntu 22.04).

# Usage

1. Download **setup** and save it in your user directory (in WSL). Alternatively, you can create a new file, name it as you wish, and copy the contents from the setup script into it.
2. Make sure to give execution permission:
```bash
chmod +x ./setup
```
3. Run it:
```bash
./setup
```
